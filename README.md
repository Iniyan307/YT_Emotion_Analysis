## Features:
###   - Real time data - Scrapes Youtube Comments
###   - Uses **BERT** Algorithm
###   - Friendly User Interface
###   - Uses NLP to analyze opinions, feelings, and emotions.
###   - Visualization for easy interpretation of the result
### <br>

## Requirements:
###   - Operating System: Requires a 64-bit OS (Windows 10 or Ubuntu) for compatibility with deep learning frameworks.
###   - Development Environment: Python 3.6 or later is necessary for coding the sign language detection system.
###   - SQuAD v1.1 & v2.0 needed for the usage of BERT Transformer model
###   - Version Control: Implementation of Git for collaborative development and effective code management.
###   - IDE: Use of VSCode as the Integrated Development Environment for coding, debugging, and version control integration.
###   - Additional Dependencies: Includes scikit-learn, FLASK, and Mediapipe for deep learning tasks.

## Results:
###   - The performance of our classifiers by considering two datasets of tweets and we obtained a remarkable 92% accuracy for sentiment analysis and a 90% accuracy for emotion analysis, from which it was possible to deduce that BERT’s language modeling power significantly contributes to achieve a good text classification.
###   -Experiments have shown that the models achieve an accuracy of 0.92 and 0.90 on, respectively, sentiment analysis and emotion recognition.
